# Backend Trip

## Overview
This is a simple backend application built with **Express** and **CORS** to serve as a foundation for a trip management system.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your local machine.  
  You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend_trip.git
cd backend_trip
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- **express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **cors**: Package to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

## Available Scripts

### 1. Start the development server
To run the backend in development mode, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application using **nodemon**, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the backend API at `http://localhost:3000`.
